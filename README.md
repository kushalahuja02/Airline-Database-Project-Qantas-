# Airline Database Project Qantas
# Airline Database Project

## Overview
This project is a database system for an airline company, inspired by Qantas Airlines. Using SQL, it manages and organizes data pertinent to various airline operations. The database is designed with fictional data modeled on the attributes found on the Qantas Airlines website, offering a realistic yet imaginary dataset.

## Inspiration
The project emulates Qantas Airlines to replicate real-world airline database complexities. It provides a practical example of database design and management in the airline industry.

## Database Structure
The database comprises eight main entities (tables) for different airline operations aspects:

1. **Booking**: Information about flight bookings, including fares and dates.
2. **Ticket**: Details related to issued tickets.
3. **Customer**: Customer information like name, contact, passport, citizenship, and email.
4. **Baggage**: Baggage details, including quantities.
5. **Boarding Pass**: Boarding pass information, including origin, destination, dates, and gates.
6. **Flight**: Flight-related details such as departure, arrival, and duration.
7. **Airplane**: Airplane models and numbers.
8. **Seats**: Seat details, including numbers and types (business, economy, first class).

## Advanced SQL Techniques
This project extensively uses advanced SQL techniques to answer complex business questions:

- **Joins**: To combine data from multiple tables, providing a comprehensive view of operations.
- **Subqueries**: For complex data retrieval, allowing for more detailed and nuanced information extraction.

These techniques demonstrate the database's ability to handle intricate queries and provide deep insights into airline operations.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
An ERD has been created to visually represent the database structure. This diagram illustrates how each table is interconnected, showcasing relationships, primary keys, and foreign keys, providing a clear overview of the database schema.

## Implementation Details
Implemented using SQL, the database features:

- Tables with primary and foreign keys for data integrity.
- Constraints and checks for data validity.
- Views for easier data access and manipulation.
- Sample data inserts for realistic scenarios.

## Queries and Operations
Queries demonstrate capabilities like customer information retrieval, flight and booking details, and complex joins for data analysis.

## Requirements
- SQL Database Management System (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Understanding of SQL queries and database operations.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone or download SQL scripts.
2. Execute scripts in an SQL database management system.
3. Modify, insert, or query data as needed.
